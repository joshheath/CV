I am an enthusiastic and ambitious full stack junior developer, having recently graduated from Makers Academy, an intensive 12 week development bootcamp.

Before pursuing a career in tech, I trained and worked in corporate law in London and Hong Kong for four years. This professional experience provided me with a broad set of analytical and communication skills which complement the development skills I have learnt since.

I am looking to pursue a career in the tech sector in London, preferably involving environmental and sustainable technology, or music
