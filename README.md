### Joshua Heath
I have recently decided to become a software developer, having trained and worked in corporate law in London and Hong Kong for the past four years. I want to put the analytical and communication skills learned over this period to use a progressive and existing sector. 

I am a current student at Makers Academy, an intensive 12 week development bootcamp, training to become a full-stack junior web developer. Following this I am looking to pursue a career in the tech sector in London, preferably involving environmental or sustainable technology.
