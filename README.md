I am an enthusiastic and ambitious full stack junior developer, having recently graduated from Makers Academy, an intensive 12 week development bootcamp.

Before pursuing a career in tech, I trained and worked in corporate law in London and Hong Kong for four years. This professional experience provided me with a broad set of analytical and communication skills which complement the development skills I have learnt since.

I am looking to pursue a career in the tech sector in London, preferably involving environmental and sustainable technology, or music.

## Skills
Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.
- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

### Analytical
Working as a litigator involved having to digest large volumes of information relating to a case and working out which pieces were relevant to the client. In order to do this effectively, I had to be logical and creative, both of which are traits I feel are essential to become a successful developer. 
 
### Communication
- Drafting witness statements and applications to court
- Succinct and effective communication absolutely essential

### Working style
- Personally motivated
- As part of a team - working in HK, delegating 
- Flexible - 


## Education
### Makers Academy (May - August 2018)
- I have just come to the end of 12 rewarding and intense weeks at Makers Academy. The course is split, with the weeks spent either pairing or working in groups, and the weekends focused on self-led programming. 
- Some of the technologies used over the course include: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Rspec, Cypress, Jasmine, PostgreSQL, Mongo DB, Github, Trello. 
- There is a focus on Test Driven Development and Object-Oriented Design which has instilled a strong sense of the right way to tackle coding problems. 
- The course has also given me supporting knowledge, such as where to start when approaching a problem, what resources to use and how to find solutions. 
- Five of the 12 weeks are spent working in groups, which have allowed me put XP values into practice and gain an understanding of how to get the best out of myself and the team as a whole.

## Interests
- I am a keen scuba diver, currently holding an Advanced PADI certification and hoping to progress on to Rescue Diver.
- I love to travel and have been lucky enough to go on extended trips through Central America, South America and the Middle East. Also, whilst working in Hong Kong I managed to take (perhaps too many) shorter trips to surrounding countries, including China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Thailand. 
- I participate in an art camp at Burning Man each year, that bring hundreds of canvases and paints to the desert and runs art workshops and events for the temporary residents of Black Rock City.
