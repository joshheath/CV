I am an enthusiastic and ambitious junior developer, and recent graduate of Makers Academy. I am now looking to embark on a career in the tech sector in London at a company where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer.

Before pursuing a career in tech, I trained and worked in corporate law in London and Hong Kong for four years. This professional experience provided me with a broad set of analytical and communication skills which complement the development skills I have learnt since. 

I decided to pursue a career in tech as, during my time in law, I noticed numerous inefficiencies that could have been solved with a knowledge of coding. This, coupled with a desire to work in a progressive and exciting sector, was what first made me consider learning to code.

## Skills
### Analytical
- Working as a litigator involved having to digest large volumes of information relating to cases and working out which pieces were relevant to the client. 
- To do this effectively, I had to be logical and creative in thinking about the problem and developing a solution that was appropriate. 
- These skills have been used on a daily basis whilst at Makers, thinking through coding problems and trying out new technology to try and solve them.
 
### Communication
- Since starting Makers I have had plenty of opportunity to explain and discuss new concepts and ideas with people from both coding and non-coding backgrounds and am adept at explaining tricky concepts in an accessible way. For an example, please see the following Readme files I have written for recent projects: [1](https://github.com/joshheath/MA_final_project/blob/master/README.md), [2](https://github.com/joshheath/stinkbugs-bnb).
- Previous professional experience involved cross-examining and questioning witnesses, for which I gained special recognition. This required creativity in thinking through and approaching issues, and then presenting these ideas to the recipient in a succinct and effective manner. 

### Working style
- I am able to work well with all personality types and effectively both in groups or individually. 
- I am enthusiastic and and always keen to contribute, whilst also being an effective listener. 
- I constantly strive to grow and build my skills and knowledge - this includes being self-motivated to go and find solutions myself and also being open and receptive to feedback on my performance. 

## Education
### Makers Academy (May - August 2018)
- I have just come to the end of 12 rewarding and intense weeks at Makers Academy. The course is split, with the weeks spent either pairing or working in groups, and the weekends focused on self-led programming. 
- Some of the technologies used over the course include: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js, React, HTML, CSS, Rspec, Jest, Cypress, Jasmine, PostgreSQL, Mongo DB, Github and Trello. 
- There is a focus on Test Driven Development and Object-Oriented Design which has instilled a strong sense of the right way to tackle coding problems. 
- The course has also given me supporting knowledge, such as where to start when approaching a problem, what resources to use and how to find solutions. 
- Five of the 12 weeks are spent working in groups, which have allowed me put XP values into practice and gain an understanding of how to get the best out of myself and the team as a whole.

## Interests
- I am a keen scuba diver, currently holding an Advanced PADI certification and hoping to progress on to Rescue Diver. This has taken me to jungle caves in Mexico and to (slightly more chilly) glacier meltwater lakes in Iceland. 
- I participate in an art camp at Burning Man each year, that brings hundreds of canvases and paints to the desert and runs art workshops and events for the temporary residents of Black Rock City.
